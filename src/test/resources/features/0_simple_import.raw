Feature: Simple Attack Pattern Imports

  Scenario: Import and validate a Attack Pattern from a third-party System

    Given a STIX JSON object "/json/0_simple_object.json"
#    Given a STIX Bundle at...
#    When I parse the Bundle
#    Then it should have 5 objects
#    Given JSON provided at "POST" /scenario1
#    When I parse it, it should be a "AttackPattern"
#    And it's "created_by_ref" must match the producer
#    and the property "createdAt" must have millisecond precision
    When I parse it as STIX
    Then it must have property "key" as type "NUMBER"
#    Then make the object available at "GET" "/scenario1"
#    When I receive a response at "POST" "/scenario1" it indicates the respondent has validated the object in their system and provided a updated object
#    Then validate the response as a "AttackPattern"
#    And the following properties must be different then the previous version
#    | count | last_observed | created_by_ref

#    and it must have a different "id"
    Then print the object
